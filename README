This is the admin party
=================================

This is a very simple rest API demonstrating some of the features of Postgres 9.4
JSON SQL with the Anorm database framework.

To properly enjoy this application, you must have a running instance of Postgres 9.4.
Also you should configure it by adding details to conf/application.conf

Then, if the gods favor you, you may cd to the admin-party directory, and run activator.
And run the app!
